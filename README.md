# Building the Best Fantasy NBA Starting 5
The 2019-2020 NBA season will go down in history as a strange and emotionally draining season. The league was more or less balancedâ€”the league that was previously dominated by super-teams was now filled with dynamic-duos, for the first time in what seems like a decade the championship was up for grabs, and fans all over the world watched in excitement to see who would come out on top. But in March, 2020, the NBA season came to an unexpected halt after the infamous COVID-19 virus infiltrated its first NBA locker room at the Vivint Smart Home Arena. The future of the season was in turmoil. Would the season just end there with no crowned champion? What would this mean for the next season?  

After months of fans and players alike eagerly waited on the fate of the season, on June 4, NBA's Board of Governors announced a plan to restart the season, and on July 30, NBA fans rejoiced. Not only was the NBA season back on, but fantasy NBA sports betting made a strong resurgence.

In this project, we're going to figure out the best candidates for a fantasy NBA roster based on the players' average performance over the course of the season.

_Disclaimer: The player stats were taken from the 2017-2018 NBA season due to restrictions on available data, however the same analysis can be performed on newer data once it is available._

## The Results
After evaluating each player's stats and Fantasy player value, the best players to choose to form a starting five lineup would be:
* __Point Guards:__ Russell Westbrook and James Harden
* __Shooting Guards:__ DeMar DeRozan and CJ McCollum
* __Small Forwards:__ Lebron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo
* __Center:__ Anthony Davis

## The Data
The player data contains statistics on players from 1950 up until 2018, including stats like 3-point percentage, number of field goals, minutes played, etc. The data and data description can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats?select=Seasons_Stats.csv).
